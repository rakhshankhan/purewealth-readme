## Background

More and more Muslims—and ethically conscious investors in general—are seeking financial solutions that are in alignment with **responsible corporate behavior** and **Shariah principles**. While many financial institutions have laid out solid frameworks for Shariah compliance, the evaluation process remains largely manual, time-consuming, and prone to errors. **Purewealth** aims to simplify this.

## How It Works

1. **Frontend**: Users interact with an intuitive Next.js/React interface, searching for or selecting a company to evaluate.
2. **Evaluation Controller**: Receives the user’s request and orchestrates the process.
3. **Scraper Service**: Collects key data from multiple sources, including:
   - Financial statements
   - Public reports & stakeholder communications
   - Structured and unstructured data sets
4. **Natural Language Processing**: Cleans and standardizes the scraped data.
5. **LLM Analysis**:
   - Feeds the structured data into a **fine-tuned LLaMa model**.
   - The model applies **S&P Global’s Shariah Compliance Framework** to determine if a company meets Shariah standards.
6. **Results & Storage**: The LLM evaluation is returned to the Evaluation Controller, displayed to the user, and stored in **MongoDB** for future reference.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Next.js / React (TypeScript, JavaScript, CSS)
- **Backend**: Python (Flask/FastAPI, etc.)
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **LLM**: LLaMa (trained & fine-tuned in-house)
- **Infrastructure**: Docker
- **Version Control**: Git

## Next Steps

- **Expand Shariah Criteria**: Broaden the scope of evaluation to include more intricate facets of Islamic finance.
- **Refine NLP Pipelines**: Improve accuracy in data extraction and structure.
- **Enhanced User Interface**: Make data visualization more intuitive and interactive.
- **Integration with Other Frameworks**: Incorporate additional ethical investing criteria.
